## Install

Worldkiln currently supports Windows 10 and 11.

Download the current public build from the [Worldkiln download page](https://aeowun.com/downloads/) or from the repository's Releases page.

### Current public installation

Worldkiln installs its application files and project data under the Aeowun application directory.

Projects are stored under `UserData/` by default.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — 0.8.x installation

The current 0.8.x development installation contract uses:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aeowun\
├── .assets\
├── UserData\
├── Worldkiln.exe
└── LICENSE
```

The development installer can:

- Install the canonical `Worldkiln.exe`.
- Create a Worldkiln Desktop shortcut.
- Restore missing application files.
- Preserve existing project and asset content.
- Prompt to launch Worldkiln when installation completes.
- Display installer failures directly in the installer UI.

---

## Project Structure

A typical project contains:

```text
MyProject/
├── world.dat
├── scripts/
├── playerscripts/
└── .assets/
```

- `world.dat` stores the project World and its authored objects.
- `scripts/` contains standalone and reusable AeoScript Modules.
- `playerscripts/` contains scripts associated with the Player.
- `.assets/` contains textures, audio, packages, UI, and other project assets.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — Save data

0.8.x gameplay save data is stored separately from the authored project.

Save data is not stored inside:

```text
world.dat
project.json
scripts/
the authored project directory
```

---

## World

The World is the authored voxel environment.

Worldkiln supports:

- Block construction and erasing.
- Multi-selection.
- Copy and paste.
- Selection dragging.
- Multiple build planes.
- Surface-aware building.
- Block colors and textures.
- Lights.
- Audio Emitters.
- Spawn Points.
- Sky environments.
- Undo and Redo.
- Large chunked voxel Worlds.

Changes made through ordinary gameplay during Play mode do not overwrite the authored World.

---

## Actors

Actors are authored game objects that exist alongside the voxel World.

They can represent:

- Characters.
- NPCs.
- Props.
- Weapons.
- Tools.
- Items.
- Switches.
- Interactive objects.
- Other packaged game objects.

Actors can have their own:

- Identity.
- Position.
- Visibility.
- Enabled state.
- Package.
- Physics configuration.
- Attributes.
- AeoScript Modules.

During Play mode, authored Actors become runtime Entities.

Character Packages can additionally provide Character movement, animation, rigging, and other Character capabilities.

Actors are separate from voxel Cells.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — Expanded Actor authoring

0.8.x development adds:

- Authored rotation.
- Authored scale.
- Collider size.
- Collider offset.
- Automatic package-derived collider dimensions.
- Solid Actor-to-Character collision.
- Character grounding on solid Actors.
- Improved collision alignment between rendered Actors and their runtime physics representation.

---

## AeoScript

AeoScript is the gameplay scripting language built for Worldkiln.

```aeoscript
debug.log("Game loaded")

gold: number = 0

on on_gold(amount) {
    gold += amount
}
```

AeoScript supports:

- Variables and constants.
- Functions.
- Events.
- Closures.
- `wait()`.
- Reusable Modules.
- Actor-attached Modules.
- Input.
- Cells, Actors, and Entities.
- UI.
- Audio.
- Animation.
- Attachments.
- Collision events.
- Player and camera control.
- Creating and removing runtime game objects.

Scripts can run as standalone gameplay systems or be attached to Actors and other supported objects.

Reusable Modules can maintain runtime state, accept arguments, return values, call other Modules, and suspend through `wait()`.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — AeoScript runtime improvements

0.8.x development adds or expands:

- Actor navigation.
- Persistent save state.
- More detailed runtime error locations.
- Improved nested Module ownership and execution.
- Improved runtime UI property validation.
- Additional Module and object-state reliability fixes.

---

## UI

Worldkiln includes UI authoring for game interfaces.

UI elements include:

- Panels.
- Text.
- Buttons.

UI controls can use responsive anchors and can be accessed from AeoScript using script keys.

```aeoscript
const health_text = ui.find("health_text")
```

Scripts can also create Panels, Text, and Buttons during Play mode.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — Expanded UI Authoring

0.8.x development expands the authoring workspace with:

- Reorganized Inspector sections.
- Preview resolutions:
  - `1280x720`
  - `1600x900`
  - `1920x1080`
  - custom dimensions
- 95% and 90% safe-area guides.
- Selection bounds.
- Resize handles.
- Anchor indicators.
- Parent-bound visualization.
- Center, edge, and sibling snapping.
- Visible snap guides.
- Hierarchy drag-and-drop reparenting.
- Root reparenting.
- Recovery access for invalid or unattached nodes.
- Expanded Undo/Redo.
- Duplicate, rename, delete, bring-forward, and send-backward actions.
- Dialogue Panel, Top Bar, Quest Panel, Satchel Panel, and Center Prompt presets.
- Inline validation.
- Linked and independent stretch margins.

0.8.x also adds unified Text and Button typography:

- Font size.
- Horizontal alignment.
- Vertical alignment.
- Wrapping.
- Padding.
- Line spacing.

UI authoring operations use the selected logical preview resolution instead of depending on the current editor panel dimensions.

---

## Navigation

> **UNRELEASED / TESTING — 0.8.x**

Worldkiln's 0.8.x development branch includes engine-level navigation for voxel Worlds.

Navigation is derived from supported voxel surfaces and accounts for configurable agent dimensions and traversal limits.

Navigation agents can define:

- Width.
- Height.
- Maximum step-up.
- Maximum step-down.

The system includes deterministic path queries and editor visualization of navigation data.

Actors can use engine-owned navigation through AeoScript:

```aeoscript
self.parent.navigate_to([12, 4, -8], 3.0, 0.5)
```

Navigation can be controlled with:

```aeoscript
self.parent.cancel_navigation()
self.parent.is_navigating()
```

Actor Modules can respond to completion and failure:

```aeoscript
self.parent.on_navigation_finished = fn() {
    debug.log("Destination reached")
}

self.parent.on_navigation_failed = fn(reason) {
    debug.log(reason)
}
```

The navigation follower can detect when a route stops making physical progress and report a failure instead of continuing indefinitely.

---

## Save State

> **UNRELEASED / TESTING — 0.8.x**

Worldkiln's 0.8.x development branch includes project-specific persistent gameplay state.

Supported value types are:

- `number`
- `bool`
- `string`

Example:

```aeoscript
save.set("gold", 250)
save.set("quest_complete", true)
save.commit()
```

Values can be read with:

```aeoscript
const gold = save.get("gold")
const exists = save.has("gold")
```

Values can be removed with:

```aeoscript
save.remove("gold")
save.commit()
```

Save mutations remain staged in runtime memory until `save.commit()` succeeds.

Gameplay save data is separate from authored World data.

---

## Physics and Collision

Worldkiln runs Play-mode physics separately from authored World state.

Physics includes:

- Configurable World gravity.
- Dynamic voxel bodies.
- Character movement.
- Grounding.
- World collision.
- Runtime object movement.
- Contact events.

AeoScript can react to collision-driven gameplay through callbacks such as `on_touch`.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — Actor collision

0.8.x development expands Actor physics with:

- Authored collider dimensions.
- Collider offsets.
- Package-derived collider defaults.
- Solid Actor-to-Character collision.
- Character grounding on Actor surfaces.
- Non-solid trigger Actors that continue generating contact events without blocking movement.

---

## Animation and Attachments

Worldkiln supports Character animation and runtime attachments.

Character systems include:

- Idle and locomotion animation.
- Animation blending.
- Layered one-shot actions.
- Named rig attachment points.

Objects can be attached to named rig points through AeoScript:

```aeoscript
attach(sword, player, "RightHand", "Grip")
```

Attached objects follow the evaluated Character pose.

Objects can later be detached:

```aeoscript
detach(sword)
```

Their runtime movement and physics behavior can then resume.

---

## Play Mode

Play mode runs the current project directly inside Worldkiln.

Gameplay can use:

- Characters.
- Actors.
- Physics.
- Scripts.
- UI.
- Audio.
- Animation.
- Attachments.
- Collision events.
- Cameras.
- Keyboard and mouse input.

Runtime-created Cells, Entities, UI, attachments, and other temporary simulation state are discarded when Play mode ends.

Authored project data remains the source of truth for the World being built.

### UNRELEASED / TESTING — Persistent gameplay state

0.8.x save data is an intentional exception to ordinary temporary Play-mode state.

Values explicitly committed through the `save` API persist separately from authored project data.

---

## Build a Game

Worldkiln can package a project as a standalone Windows game.

```text
Create project
      ↓
Build world
      ↓
Add Actors
      ↓
Write gameplay
      ↓
Play
      ↓
Build game
```

Completed builds are stored under:

```text
UserData/Builds/
```

Built games can also be discovered and launched from the Worldkiln Home screen.
